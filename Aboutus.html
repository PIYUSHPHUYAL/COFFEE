<h2>History</h2>
    <p align="justify"> Coffee House cafe was initially named as town's cafe in late 90's later, Piyush Phuyal owned it and named as Coffee house cafe. It serves Newa Estate coffee which is also grown, picked, sorted, and ground in Nepal. The café is located in the middle of Sukedhara which has an outdoor space with a lily pond, shops nearby, and a beautiful area to walk around or picnic. There’s on-site parking and it’s away from the hustle and bustle of the main roads making it a mini escape from the city. The most beautiful part is the artsy modern vibe with a bold hand painted mural on the wall, rustic wood details, and flowers hanging from the ceiling.If all that wasn’t enough, the food and coffee is really good here.<br> <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp -Piyush Phuyal</p>
